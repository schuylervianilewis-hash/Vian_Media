* Timestamp: 2026-08-28T19:20:00Z
* Summary: Fixed screen lock/unlock orientation reset and playback reset (00:00) by persisting URI permissions, restoring orientation, auto-recovering idle controllers, and fallback duration retention.
* Files touched:
  - app/src/main/java/com/example/MainActivity.kt
  - app/src/main/java/com/example/ui/screens/PlayerScreen.kt
  - app/src/main/java/com/example/ui/screens/PlaybackProgressRow.kt
  - BLUEPRINT.md
  - receipts/RECEIPTS_026.md
* What was actually done:
  - Added `persistUriPermissions` in `MainActivity` to request persistable read/write permissions on incoming content URIs so external file provider access (e.g. from MiXplorer) remains valid across lock/background state.
  - Forwarded `FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION` and data URI when starting `PlaybackService`.
  - Added `openFileDescriptor` fallback for `MediaMetadataRetriever` in `PlayerScreen` when extracting video dimensions.
  - Added `lastKnownIsPortrait` using `rememberSaveable` to persist orientation state and re-assert sensor landscape/portrait on `ON_RESUME` after unlocking.
  - Added auto-recovery on `ON_RESUME` in `PlayerScreen` to re-bind `PlayerView.player`, re-prepare media item, and seek back to saved playback position if the controller was idle or reset during lock.
  - Updated `PlaybackProgressRow` to accept fallback duration and position and prevent `C.TIME_UNSET` from resetting valid duration displays to `00:00`.

* Summary: Lowered seekbar and playback buttons in FloatingVideoPlayerOverlay, aligned minimize and close actions beside playback buttons in a single bottom row, and pinned the corner resize handle to remain fixed size and stuck to bottom-right corner.
* Files touched:
  - app/src/main/java/com/example/ui/components/FloatingVideoPlayerOverlay.kt
  - BLUEPRINT.md
  - receipts/RECEIPTS_026.md
* What was actually done:
  - Removed excessive bottom padding from floating video controls container.
  - Sized playback buttons (`SkipPrevious`, `Play/Pause`, `SkipNext`) to compact 32dp targets directly under the seekbar.
  - Moved `Minimize` and `Close` action buttons to sit alongside playback controls in the same unified bottom row.
  - Anchored the corner `Resize` drag handle (`ZoomOutMap`) strictly to the `BottomEnd` with fixed dimensions so window scaling does not warp button touch targets.

  - app/src/main/java/com/example/ui/navigation/AppNavigation.kt
  - BLUEPRINT.md
  - receipts/RECEIPTS_026.md
* What was actually done:
  - Overrode `finish()` and updated `onDestroy()` in `MainActivity` to reset `requestedOrientation` to `ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_UNSPECIFIED`.
  - Guarded `updateOrientation` in `PlayerScreen` to verify the host Activity is not finishing/destroyed and the controller is not idle/ended/empty before applying orientation changes.
  - Reset `requestedOrientation` to `SCREEN_ORIENTATION_UNSPECIFIED` in `PlayerScreen`'s `BackHandler` and `onDispose` block.
  - Reset `requestedOrientation` in `AppNavigation` before invoking `popBackStack()` or `finish()`.

  - app/src/main/java/com/example/ui/screens/PlayerScreen.kt
  - app/src/main/java/com/example/service/PlaybackService.kt
  - receipts/RECEIPTS_026.md
* What was actually done:
  - Updated `PlayerManager.customMediaCodecSelector` to automatically prioritize software decoders (like `c2.android.vp9.decoder` and `c2.android.opus.decoder`) when Unisoc/Sprd chipsets are detected or when VP9/Opus streams encounter failing hardware decoders.
  - Made `PlayerManager.release()` fully asynchronous via background dispatcher to prevent blocking the main Choreographer thread during codec deadlocks.
  - In `PlayerScreen.kt`, pause and stop the player prior to clearing the surface and capped decoding error auto-retries to 2 attempts, preventing infinite retry loops.
  - In `PlaybackService.kt`, capped decoding error auto-retries to 2 attempts and reset counter upon `onMediaItemTransition`.

  - BLUEPRINT.md
  - receipts/RECEIPTS_026.md
* What was actually done:
  - Created `com.example.data.CacheManager` with utilities to safely calculate non-library cache size, recursively purge temporary cache files and image caches, and auto-purge orphaned editing/converting files at startup.
  - In `MainActivity.kt`, removed Coil `.diskCache` (Option 0: Memory-only cache, 0 MB disk footprint) and triggered background startup purge for orphaned temp files.
  - In `CompressionService.kt`, automatically deleted intermediate edited input files (`edited_*.jpg` from PhotoEditorScreen) upon compression completion in the `finally` block.
  - In `FFmpegService.kt`, deleted temporary inputs residing in `cacheDir` (such as `editor_converted_*.mp4`) upon processing completion and added orphan sweeps in `onCreate` and `onDestroy`.
  - In `VideoEditorScreen.kt`, tracked session temporary files via `sessionTempFiles`, deleted `inputFile` immediately after pre-conversion, and registered a `DisposableEffect` to purge all session temp files when navigating away.
  - In `SettingsScreen.kt`, added an "Unused App Data & Cache" section in `StorageSettingsPage` displaying dynamic cache size and an interactive "Clear Unused Data" button with asynchronous progress indication and Toast feedback.

* Summary: Fixed video playback freezing/stuck at 0:00 upon unlocking screen by removing redundant seekTo(0) in STATE_IDLE, preserving playWhenReady across backgrounding, and preventing surface detachment on AndroidView reset.
* Files touched:
  - app/src/main/java/com/example/ui/screens/PlayerScreen.kt
  - app/src/main/java/com/example/ui/components/FloatingVideoPlayerOverlay.kt
  - BLUEPRINT.md
  - receipts/RECEIPTS_026.md
* What was actually done:
  - In `PlayerScreen.kt`:
    - Added `wasPlayingBeforePause` (persisted via `rememberSaveable`) to remember whether the user was actively playing prior to screen lock/pause.
    - In `ON_PAUSE`, recorded `isCurrentlyPlaying = controller.isPlaying || controller.playWhenReady` into `wasPlayingBeforePause`.
    - In `ON_RESUME`, differentiated whether the media item is already active: if current media matches `decodedUri`, call `controller.prepare()` on `STATE_IDLE` without resetting position or calling `setMediaItem`, and cleanly resume playback if `wasPlayingBeforePause` was true.
    - In `LaunchedEffect(uriString, mediaController)`, separated `STATE_ENDED` (which rewinds to 0) from `STATE_IDLE` (which only calls `prepare()` and resumes without seeking to 0).
    - In the double-tap gesture and center Play/Pause button handlers, removed mandatory `controller.seekTo(0)` on `STATE_IDLE`, and updated `wasPlayingBeforePause` on play/pause actions.
    - In `AndroidView`, prevented setting `view.player = null` during `onReset` to avoid destroying the ExoPlayer rendering surface and triggering decoder detachment during lock/unlock recompositions.
  - In `FloatingVideoPlayerOverlay.kt`:
    - Removed `controller.seekTo(0)` on `STATE_IDLE` in the play/pause button handler.
  - In `BLUEPRINT.md`:
    - Documented the playback resumption and surface detachment fix in the progress ledger.

  - BLUEPRINT.md
  - receipts/RECEIPTS_026.md
* What was actually done:
  - In `FFmpegService.kt`: Added explicit pause of `PlayerManager.exoPlayer` upon starting foreground execution to yield CPU cores and hardware decoders to FFmpegKit.
  - In `CompressionService.kt`: Added explicit pause of `PlayerManager.exoPlayer` upon starting foreground compression to prevent memory contention/OOM during heavy bitmap processing.
  - In `VideoEditorScreen.kt`:
    - Added `DisposableEffect(Unit)` pausing background playback on screen entry to prevent hardware decoder starvation.
    - Added `exoPlayer?.pause()` prior to initiating FFmpeg export render jobs.
  - In `PhotoEditorScreen.kt`: Added `DisposableEffect(Unit)` pausing background playback on screen entry to free memory for high-resolution image editing.
  - In `AudioTrimmerScreen.kt`: Added `PlayerManager.exoPlayer?.pause()` on screen entry to prevent concurrent audio playback.
  - In `PlayerScreen.kt`: Added a 1000ms delay to background playlist loading to prioritize initial video buffering and decoder setup, and skipped device-wide `MediaRepository.getMediaFolders()` scans entirely if `FFmpegStatus.isRunning` or `CompressionStatus.isRunning`.
  - In `BLUEPRINT.md`: Documented the Heavy Resource Exclusivity Architecture milestone.

  - Added `controlsInteractionTrigger` state (`mutableLongStateOf(0L)`) in `PlayerScreen.kt`.
  - Updated auto-hide `LaunchedEffect` key from `LaunchedEffect(showControls)` to `LaunchedEffect(showControls, controlsInteractionTrigger)`, causing any control interaction to cancel and reset the 4000ms auto-hide countdown.
  - Wrapped the top controls background gradient and overlay column inside a dedicated top container `Box` with `pointerInput(Unit)` consuming taps (`detectTapGestures`) and resetting `controlsInteractionTrigger` on down gestures (`awaitFirstDown(requireUnconsumed = false)`).
  - Wrapped the bottom controls background gradient and overlay column inside a dedicated bottom container `Box` with identical pointer event interception.

* What was actually done:
  - Replaced truncated integer volume quantization (`virtualNewVolume = (...).toInt()`) with continuous normalized float ratio tracking (`startVolumeRatio + volumeChange`).
  - Added discrete threshold checking for `AudioManager.setStreamVolume` and `PlayerManager.applyAudioBoosterSettings` to only dispatch hardware updates when boundary values change.
  - Linked `gestureVolumeRatio` and HUD text directly to the continuous ratio (`(currentRatio * 200).roundToInt()`), ensuring smooth step-by-step increments (1, 2, 3, 4...) and fluid vertical fill bar animations.

  - BLUEPRINT.md
  - receipts/RECEIPTS_026.md
* What was actually done:
  - Created `VianApplication` and registered it in `AndroidManifest.xml` to initialize `LogKeeper` before any Activity, Service, or ContentProvider starts.
  - Refactored `LogKeeper.kt` to write crash dumps and log exports using `MediaStore.Downloads` API (API 29+) with a secondary failsafe write to `context.getExternalFilesDir(Environment.DIRECTORY_DOWNLOADS)`, completely bypassing legacy Scoped Storage `EACCES` permission blocks.
  - Initialized `LogKeeper` at the very first line of `MainActivity.onCreate()` and wrapped intent extra parsing (`getParcelableExtra`, `getParcelableArrayListExtra`, `takePersistableUriPermission`) in `try/catch` to eliminate crashes caused by `BadParcelableException` and ungranted URI permissions.
  - Fixed Jetpack Navigation Compose `NavHost` crashes when receiving external video intents by anchoring `startDestination` strictly to `startDest` (`main` or `welcome`) and routing via `LaunchedEffect(intentDest)` with `popUpTo(startDest) { inclusive = false }` and `launchSingleTop = true`.
  - Updated Base64 URL route encoding across `AppNavigation.kt` to explicitly include `NO_PADDING` (`URL_SAFE or NO_WRAP or NO_PADDING`) and wrapped Base64 decoding in `PlayerScreen.kt` with a `try/catch` fallback to prevent route parser crashes.
  - Added `.fallbackToDestructiveMigration()` in `AppDatabase.kt` to prevent SQLite startup lockout if local Room schemas mismatch.
  - Replaced all `getColumnIndexOrThrow` calls in `MediaRepository.kt` with guarded `getColumnIndex` lookups checking for `-1` to safeguard against missing optional columns on OEM ROMs or SAF DocumentsContract queries.

  - Updated visible app name in `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` to `Vian Media TEST`.
  - Fixed variable scoping error in `CompressionService.kt` by declaring `val uri = Uri.parse(uriStr)` before the `try` block, making it accessible in the `finally` cleanup block without modifying service design.
  - Resolved unresolved reference and operator/type inference errors in `PlayerScreen.kt` by qualifying `androidx.compose.runtime.mutableIntStateOf(0)` for `decoderRetryCount`.
  - Restored `PlaybackProgressRow` call in `PlayerScreen.kt` to match the old working repository, eliminating the call to nonexistent `SettingsManager.getPlaybackState()`.

* What was actually done:
  - Added an `IconButton` in `FloatingVideoPlayerOverlay.kt` topbar that triggers `onSwitchToMiniPlayer`, using `Icons.AutoMirrored.Filled.PlaylistPlay`.
  - Added a loop toggle `IconButton` to the controls row directly after playback buttons (`SkipPrevious`, `Play/Pause`, `SkipNext`) under the seekbar, cycling `repeatMode` through `OFF` -> `ALL` -> `ONE` -> `OFF` and updating in real-time.
  - Lowered playback buttons and seekbar in `FloatingVideoPlayerOverlay.kt` by tightening bottom alignment padding on the container `Column` (`bottom = 0.dp`), seekbar `PlaybackProgressRow` (`vertical = 0.dp`), and controls `Row` (`top = 0.dp, bottom = 2.dp`).
  - Added dynamic video aspect ratio calculation and listener `onAspectRatioChanged` in `FloatingVideoPlayerOverlay.kt`, hooking into ExoPlayer's `videoSize` and `onVideoSizeChanged`.
  - Updated `PlaybackService.kt` to dynamically adjust `WindowManager.LayoutParams` width and height according to video aspect ratio during playback, window resizing, and switching between mini and video player modes, as well as configuring `PlayerView.resizeMode = RESIZE_MODE_FIT`.

* What was actually done:
  - Created headless `LogCatcher` engine managing persistent internal log file (`logs/active_session.log`) with thread-safe asynchronous disk writes dispatched on `Dispatchers.IO` to prevent main-thread UI stalls.
  - Implemented 2MB threshold detector (`MAX_LOG_SIZE_BYTES = 2L * 1024 * 1024`). When active log reaches or exceeds 2MB, automatically exports content asynchronously to device `Downloads` folder via `MediaStore.Downloads` (`Vianbrplay_log_auto_YYYY-MM-DD_HHmmss.txt`), resets active file and buffer back to zero, and logs an automated audit entry.
  - Retained lightweight in-memory ring-buffer (`ArrayDeque<LogEntry>` capped at 250 items) for instantaneous UI loading without holding multi-megabyte object trees in heap.
  - Maintained complete backwards compatibility in `LogKeeper.kt` by delegating `log()`, `logWarn()`, `logError()`, `init()`, and master switch toggle to `LogCatcher`.
  - Decoupled and enhanced `LoggerScreen.kt`: loads full log on-demand via `LogKeeper.loadAllLogs()`, displays real-time disk storage meter with percentage bar (`X.XX MB / 2.00 MB`), adds search text filtering across tags and stacktraces, adds confirmation dialog to clear logs, and enables manual export to Downloads.
