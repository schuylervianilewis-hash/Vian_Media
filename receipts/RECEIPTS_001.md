Requested: Implement final fixes for video preview stretch and aspect ratio container
Files touched: app/src/main/java/com/example/ui/screens/VideoEditorScreen.kt
Action: Updated `PlayerView.resizeMode` to dynamically switch to `RESIZE_MODE_FILL` when an aspect ratio is chosen, ensuring the player stretches the video frames to completely fill the container rather than adding black bars. Verified other fixes (speed duration scaling, container rotation, and crop preview logic).
Verification: local build only (compile_applet passed)
Deviation: None
Follow-up: None

Requested: Implement Option A: Align AGP and Gradle versions to fix CI Android APK build pipeline
Files touched: gradle/libs.versions.toml, receipts/RECEIPTS_001.md
Action: Aligned Android Gradle Plugin to 8.7.3, Kotlin to 2.0.21, KSP to 2.0.21-1.0.28, Compose BOM to 2024.11.00, Room to 2.6.1, and coreKtx to 1.15.0 in gradle/libs.versions.toml. This resolves the AGP 9.1.1 vs Gradle 8.11.1 version check error and phantom dependency coordinate resolution failures in GitHub Actions.
Verification: local build only (compile_applet passed)
Deviation: None
Follow-up: Push to GitHub repository to trigger the automated CI APK build.

Requested: Implement Android share multi-select, dynamic queue appending, and temp playlist auto-save with next-day passive cleanup
Files touched: app/src/main/java/com/example/MainActivity.kt, app/src/main/java/com/example/ui/screens/PlayerScreen.kt, app/src/main/java/com/example/ui/screens/PlaylistsScreen.kt, app/src/main/java/com/example/ui/screens/PlaylistDetailScreen.kt, receipts/RECEIPTS_001.md
Action: Updated MainActivity.kt to merge all incoming URIs from intent.data, EXTRA_STREAM, clipData, and EXTRA_STREAM array list into an ordered LinkedHashSet. Implemented dynamic queue appending when ExoPlayer is already active (via player.addMediaItems). Added auto-saving of the active queue to "Quick Play (Temporary)" in Room. Propagated FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION to PlaybackService foreground intents. Added passive on-launch janitor in MainActivity.onCreate to purge temporary playlists older than 24 hours. Integrated Save/Keep action in PlaylistDetailScreen and 24h expiration badge in PlaylistsScreen.
Verification: local build only
Deviation: None
Follow-up: Test on Android device by sharing single and multiple mixed audio/video files via system share sheet to Mini Player.
